AMOV project

The Following project was for academic purposes.

It was developed to consolidate the starting concepts of Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Development, Sensors and diferent APIs in the Android System.

It is fully developed in JAVA language, with the Android Studio IDE.

The project consists in a app for a Municipality that receives tickets from users where the ticket contains geolocalization for the ticket, 
anexed files and a short message reporting some problems (eg. A street lamp needs a bulb changed, you would send a ticket for the municpality with 
the location, a picture and a short message). 
It's a work in progress, needing a few graphic details.
